Summary: We study the consequences of political polarization along educational lines in the United States. We show this type of polarization has increased dramatically in the last 15 years. We show that as a result, the election of a Republican governor substantially reduces new migration of college graduates into the state. We extend a spatial model of sorting to quantify the consequences for state economic activity and the spillovers onto other states.
